# About this Repository

This repository is designed to support a hands-on workshop focused on exploring different approaches to project management and demonstrating how GitHub’s features can be used to help manage projects effectively.

* Get hands-on experience customizing GitHub’s project management features for your own projects.

## 🧰 What’s included in this repository:
* Slides and Workshop Material: Presentation slides offering guidance on project management styles and demonstrations of GitHub’s project management capabilities.
* Example Issues, Milestones, and Boards: Ready-made tasks, labels, and workflows you can adapt for your own projects.
