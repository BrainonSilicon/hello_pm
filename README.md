# About this Repository

This repository is designed to support a hands-on workshop focused on exploring different approaches to project management and demonstrating how GitHub’s features can be used to help manage projects effectively. During the session, participants will learn about how GitHub tools like repositories, issues, and milestones work with GitHub's inbuilt Projects. 

## 📚 Learning Objectives: 
* Gain an overview of various project management approaches (Agile, Waterfall, etc.)
* Learn to create, adapt, and automate GitHub project boards to suit your needs—whether you’re working solo or in a team.
* Understand how to set up milestones, adding and organizing issues, and using different board views to visualize task progress and dependencies.
* Get hands-on experience customizing GitHub’s project management features for your own projects.

## 🧰 What’s included in this repository:
* Slides and Workshop Material: Presentation slides offering guidance on project management styles and demonstrations of GitHub’s project management capabilities.
* Example Issues, Milestones, and Boards: Ready-made tasks, labels, and workflows you can adapt for your own projects.
* Supporting Files: Code of Conduct, Contribution Guidelines, and other resources that support a collaborative and reproducible project environment.
